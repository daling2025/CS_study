This video introduces several concepts useful for counting: the product rule, decision trees, slots, and sets.

The product rule is a counting technique that determines the number of ways to complete a task. If there are n steps, and each step has k options, then there are 
 possible ways to complete the task. It is important to note that k, the number of options for each step, is the base底数, and n, the number of steps (or “layers”), is the exponent指数.

A decision tree helps visualize the process, especially how each decision influences the overall outcome. It is similar to fate: every decision at a certain point may lead to a unique experience. (Life is a decision tree consisting of countless small decisions to some extent.) Each fork分叉 at a step can be seen as a “turning point” that affects the final outcome—both in the decision tree and, metaphorically, in one’s fate.

Slots provide another way to visualize the product rule, but in a more concise manner than a decision tree. The task is broken down into different “layers.” In each layer, we list the number of possibilities, then multiply these values to obtain the total number of possibilities. Slots are more compact than a decision tree because we do not need to list every possiblility at each step. On the other hand, a decision tree can sometimes be more accessible.

Finally, a set is an unordered collection of objects. (I am not sure if there are restrictions on the data types in a set—must the objects all share the same type? And should commas be used to separate them?) Sets are written using curly brackets大括号, in the format {object | description of the object} (e.g., {bead | the bead’s color is blue}).
