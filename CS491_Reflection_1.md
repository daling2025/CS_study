1. What is the research question(s) addressed in this paper? (50 words or less)

- Do online ads suggestive of arrest records appear more often with searches of black-sounding names than white-sounding names? How does this happen? How can we solve this problem?

2.  Discuss how this paper is related to your iCAN course material. Be specific and justify your response. (500 words or less)

- This paper is closely related to iCAN’s academic training because it explains how Google Ads works and exposes the racial bias within its mechanism. It illustrates what a program like AdSense involves—real-time auctions, ad placement on individual websites, profit-sharing between Google and site owners, and ad customization based on user search history. This panoramic view is valuable for understanding how to design the structure of our own projects.
We must learn to break down a large task into smaller subtasks, code and optimize each component, and ensure the tasks interact smoothly for compatibility. In short, AdSense provides a concrete example of a complete project workflow: how it connects website owners, Google users, and ad content, and how each subtask contributes to the whole system.


3.  What are the results or findings presented in the paper? Do you agree with the findings given the proposed methodology? Be specific and justify your response. (500 words or less)

- Research Findings:

  - This study examines how race-related structural bias influences Google’s ad distribution system. It finds that searches for Black-associated names are more likely to trigger ads suggestive of an arrest record, regardless of whether the individuals actually have criminal records. The study began with the assumption that there would be no difference in ad delivery between searches for Black and White names, but the findings reject this assumption.
  - The author supports this conclusion by giving examples of how Black names were unfairly associated with crime-related ads and negative sentiments, while White names typically triggered neutral or positive ads. To test this, the researcher examined three sets of names, each sharing the same first name but differing in last names, and observed whether Google ads suggested a criminal record. They also verified race by searching the names in Google Images. The results consistently showed that Black names were disproportionately associated with ads implying criminality. Then, the author applies the same methodology to thousands of names, using different IP addresses and conducting searches on different days and times, in order to examine the correlation between racially specific names and the ads delivered by Google.
Finally, the authors propose four methods to fix this bias:
      - Identifying affected groups.
      - Specifying the scope of ads to assess.
      - Determining ad sentiment.
      - Testing for adverse impact.


- My Evaluation of the Findings and Methodology: 

   - I agree with the study’s overall findings but remain critical of its methodology. The authors begin by assuming that Google’s ad content and delivery are unbiased, only to conclude that their findings contradict this assumption. To me, this approach risks being self-contradictory. Instead, I believe the research should avoid presuppositions about racial bias in Google ads and instead let the data itself reveal whether bias exists.


4.  What questions would you like future work on this topic to address? (50 words or less)
- How do AdSense’s machine learning models (if any) customize ads, and are those models biased? Specifically, how does Google’s algorithm calculate click probabilities based on search history, and what types of models are used to predict which ads a user is most likely to click?

5.  Provide a talking point (or point of discussion) related to the paper you would like to bring up in the class. Be specific and clear. (50 words or less)
- I want to discuss legal issues in privacy and data protection. AdSense and websites like peeryou.com use public records and social media content without permission. If companies profit from personal information shared online, does this raise concerns about privacy, copyright, integrity, or ethics?
