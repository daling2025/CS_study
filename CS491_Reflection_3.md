   The paper employed both quantitative and qualitative methods to examine the attributes
that define outstanding software engineers, focusing on technical skills, decision-making,
personality traits, and teamwork.

- While previous studies on what makes great software engineers tended to emphasize
technical skills and overlook non-technical ones, this research highlights that non-
technical attributes are equally important. Both aspects are also emphasized in the iCAN
program. For instance, many participants agreed that decision-making abilities and
personality traits significantly contribute to a software engineer’s success.

- In earlier sessions, we also discussed essential soft skills for engineers, such as
presenting code in an accessible way, fostering a growth mindset, and collaborating
effectively with teammates. These skills closely relate to this reading. For example, the
paper underscores the importance of continuous learning and curiosity, which align with
the growth mindset introduced during the orientation.

3. What are the results or findings presented in the paper? Do you agree with the
findings given the proposed methodology? Be specific and justify your
response. (500 words or less)

- This paper explores various attributes that may contribute to becoming an outstanding
software engineer. The researchers invited senior Microsoft engineers to select the traits
they considered most important. As a result, the top five attributes identified were: (1)
paying attention to technical details, (2) being mentally capable of handling complexity,
(3) continuously improving, (4) being honest, and (5) being open-minded. Interestingly,
attributes such as teamwork, hard work, and favor trading were not highly rated. However,
there were exceptions influenced by cultural and industry contexts—for instance, long
working hours are more common in Asia and the fast-paced gaming industry, while
China’s guanxi culture makes favor trading more acceptable.

- The study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative
research. The researchers first distributed questionnaires to a large number of Microsoft
engineers, asking them to choose the attributes they valued most. Based on these results,
they conducted follow-up interviews to understand the reasoning behind the engineers’
choices.

- Overall, I agree with the study’s methodology and findings, but I find the categorization of
attributes somewhat problematic. The researchers grouped them into four categories—
software product, decision-making, personality, and teamwork—but many of these traits
overlap. For example, a single attribute can relate simultaneously to decision-making,
collaboration, and personality.
